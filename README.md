# SinatraShoppingList
A shopping list application using Sinatra.

Users have the ability to add, update, remove and view items.

**Future fixes:**
 * Do not allow system to register the same name with different cases (i.e. Bob and bob)
 * Ask to retype password on register
 * Make it so each user has a different list
 * Make two layouts, so the bottom nav doesn’t show up until you are logged in
 * If they don’t enter an integer on add or update, tell them and don’t let them proceed
 * Create [password retrieval](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby).
